**<span className="text-[#E75E23]">Life.js</span>** is the first **fullstack agent framework**. Think of it as <span className="opacity-50">Â«</span> _the Next.js for agents_ <span className="opacity-50">Â»</span>.

It has been specifically crafted for Typescript/React, with a minimalist, low-abstraction, extensible, and **end-to-end typesafe** design. 
Read more about [our philosophy](/docs/philosophy).

## How does it feel?

```tsx

          // Insert agent demo with:
          // - Preview / Code tabs
          // - On the preview, hints like "Ask the agent about that dashboard/counter"


```

In 20 lines of code, you have a voice agent that can see and interact with the page content.


## The basics
- Control _exactly_ what the agent has "in mind" with **Memories**
- Allow the agent to perceive the interface with **Percepts**
- Execute blocking and non-blocking logic with **Actions** (tools)
- Run stateful, and multi-step logic with **Flows**

And that's it! You've understood the basics of Life.js.


## Fancy highlights
Here are some of the features we are especially proud of:

#### Non-blocking Actions

#### Percepts

#### Client-side Actions




## Simple, but powerful
If we were to compare a Life.js agent to a human:
	- ***Memories*** would be their brain ðŸ§  (knowledge and short-term memory) 
	- ***Percepts*** would be their eyes ðŸ‘€, ears ðŸ‘‚, and other feelings ðŸ¤Œ
	- ***Actions*** and ***Flows*** would be their arms and legs ðŸ’ªðŸ‘–
